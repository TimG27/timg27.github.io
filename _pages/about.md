Hi, I'm Timothy. Welcome to my new academic website!

I am a recent graduate of Computer Science and Engineering at the Vellore Institute of Technology in the warm and busy city of Chennai, India. 

Before graduating, I was a research intern first at the Centre for Data Science (under the supervision of Dr. A. Tyagi), then at the Centre for Cyber Physical Systems (under the supervision of Dr. Karthik R.). In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to intern at the AI2Lab under the supervision of Dr. Roberto Souza, in the 'Heart of the New West'- the city of Calgary, Canada.

To contact me, send an email straight to timothyg775 (at) gmail (dot) com.
