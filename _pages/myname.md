## What kind of name is 'Timothy Thomas George'?

I often get questions about my name. For many non-Indians, it's not everyday that you encounter someone with three English names. 

### 1. Which one of these names is your 'Family Name'?

Technically, none of them are. Many Indian Christians families, especially those from its southern-most states, follow a first-name-only naming convention. This custom omits our individual socially-associated surnames, emphasizing a shared common identity that goes beyond our regional, cultural, and ethnic differences.

### 2. What name do you use for yourself?

Timothy, usually. Although I don't mind being called Thomas or George or any variation of these names!

### 3. What does your name mean?

My three Christian names - 'Timothy', 'Thomas', and 'George', when joined together, represent more than a millennium of global history.

- 'Timothy' is the Anglicized form of the Greek name Timotheus (Τιμόθεος) meaning 'to honour God'. St. Timotheus (died AD 97) was the first Christian bishop of Ephesus in Ancient Greece (modern day Turkey). Timothy, in its English form, became popular in Britain following the events of the Protestant Reformation (1517).

- 'Thomas' is the Greek form of the Aramaic name Te'oma (תְּאוֹמָא) meaning 'twin'. St. Thomas (died AD 72) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, who, according to tradition, travelled from the Roman Empire all the way to the ancient harbour of Muchiri (modern day India). The name Thomas grew in popularity among the medieval Normans, after the establishment of the Knights of Saint Thomas in Acre (1191).

- 'George' is English form of the Greek name Georgios (Γεώργιος) meaning 'earthworker'. St. George (died AD 303) was a Cappadocian soldier who became a member of the Pratetorian Guard of Roman Emperor Diocletian. Tales of the 'Golden Legend' were popular during the Middle Ages, and speak of him slaying the Dragon of Silene (modern day Libya). In its current form, the name George became widely used after the ascension of King George I of Great Britian (1714).

Together, these three names span history - as far east as Asia, as far west as Europe, and as far south as Africa. Each name carries stories of creativity, innovation, and resilience. To me, they are a powerful reminder of the remarkable potential of the human spirit.
